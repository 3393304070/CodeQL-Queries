# CodeQL-Queries
This is a repository containing CodeQL queries written by Wenhao Fang during his participation in AIxCC. 

The queries aim to identify memory related vulnerabilities in C, and whilst they have shown to have relatively high sensitivity and specificity in experiments, in larger projects, they are intended to help reduce search space for dynamic techniques that verify vulnerability existence, such as fuzzing.
